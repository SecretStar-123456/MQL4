# mql4

This repository contains a random collection of [MQL4](https://www.mql4.com/)
code to be used with [MetaTrader4](https://www.metatrader4.com/).

The idea is to collect all the mql4 code I use in a central location, archive
some Experts no longer in active use, and refactor several components to reduce
duplicated code.

Not everything you find here will necessarily be functional as some code might
depend on additional libraries or indicators.
Because a lot of the MQL4 code found on the Internet does not come with
conclusive copyright information, all such code was removed here to be on the
safe side.
If you run into such problems and need help getting something to run, don't
hesitate to contact me, but please don't open any issues against this
repository in such cases (as the problem usually lies not with the code
contained herein, but with e.g. missing dependencies).
